=head2 The Journey

It's Christmas Day, marking the end of year 24 of the Perl Advent Calendar. Is
there another programming Advent Calendar with a longer history? I don't know
and, to be honest, I haven't checked, but this feels like an impressive
accomplishment and a good time to take a look back on this monumental project.

The archives begin L<in the year 2000|https://perladvent.org/2000>. In those
days, an Advent article was literally the documentation for a Perl module,
beginning with L<Data::Dumper|https://perladvent.org/2000/1/> on Dec 1 and
ending with L<Date::Christmas|https://perladvent.org/2000/25/> on the 25th. As
an aside, L<Date::Christmas> had its last release on Dec 3, 2000 and it still
works.

  #!vim text
  $ cpm install -g Date::Christmas
  $ perl -MDate::Christmas -le 'print christmasday (2023)'
  Monday

If you're interested in the history of this project and how L<Mark
Fowler|https://metacpan.org/author/MARKF> came up with it, I encourage you to
read the notes in L<the FAQ|https://perladvent.org/FAQ.html>

=head2 The Stats

When I got involved in this project last year, I had just assumed that the
calendar in its current format was much how it began, but that's not really
true. The layout and the URLs have evolved over time and there have been
varying levels of activity. Let's write a quick C<bash> script to figure out
some statistics.

    #!vim bash
    #!/usr/bin/env bash

    set -eu -o pipefail

    for year in $(seq 2000 2010); do
        found=$(find "$year" | grep -e "/\d\d/index.html" -c)
        echo "$year $(printf "%0.s🎄" $(seq 1 "$found"))"
    done

    for year in $(seq 2011 2023); do
        found=$(find "$year/articles" | grep -c pod$)
        echo "$year $(printf "%0.s🎄" $(seq 1 "$found"))"
    done

We get the following pretty graph:

We can see that  years 2000 to 2006 had 25 articles. The following 4 years
don't quite make it to 25, but I would argue that the 24 articles in 2008 is
genuinely "good enough". 2020 was sort of greatest hits repackaging of articles
from earlier years and 2021 is an outlier. Last year we had so much momentum
that we added a couple of extra articles and this year we are back to the usual
pace.

=head2 The Evolution

As we noted above, the year 2000 was strictly Perl module documentation. The
documentation angle may seem a bit weird, but back in 2000, CPAN L<wasn't all
that old|https://github.com/neilb/history-of-cpan/blob/master/history.md>.
Beginning in 2001, Mark wrote short blog posts about useful modules with his
thoughts on them.

How about the delightful Christmas-themed posts? Well, the first mention of
Santa is not until L<Dec 25, 2002|https://perladvent.org/2002/25th/>. St. Nick
does not seem to re-appear until L<Dec 10,
2006|https://perladvent.org/2006/10/>, the same year in which elves have their
first mention.

In 2011 the calendar shifts from the layout which mimics a traditional advent
calendar to one which looks more like a regular calendar. I'm guessing this is
due to the emergence of L<WWW::AdventCalendar>, which had its first release on
L<Dec 25,
2009|https://metacpan.org/release/RJBS/WWW-AdventCalendar-0.093580/view/lib/WWW/AdventCalendar.pm>.

I should also note that over the 24 years of this project there have been many,
many blog authors and editors. It has been an impressive group effort with real
continuity.

=head2 Where are we Now?

In the intervening years, the Perl Advent Calendar has become a holiday
tradition for many of us and something we look forward to. It's much more than
just an interesting project, though. It's a snapshot of Perl as it is being
used in the wild, a wonderful trip down memory lane and it documents the
evolution of a genre: technical writing that leans on and extends the
mythology of a collective Christmas traditions. Also, it's fun.

There is a real legacy to the calendar, though. I don't know how many of the
authors imagined that decades later, their work would still be available for
instructional reading and general enjoyment. Some of our personal blogs fade
away as hosting disappears or even as we ourselves move on from this earth, but
the calendar, after 24 years of service, documents the writings of Perl
developers past and present.

If you're interested in becoming part of this history, we will accept articles
throughout the year. The Call for Papers traditionally opens in the summer, but
if you have a burning desire to write a blog post for the Advent Calendar, you
can start right now and someone will be happy to help you along in the process.

=head2 A Big Thank You

For this year in particular, I'd like to thank everyone who helped out with the
calendar. L<brian d foy|https://metacpan.org/author/BDFOY>, for kickstarting
things in November when my mind was somewhere else. Also L<brian d
foy|https://metacpan.org/author/BDFOY> for reviewing articles and contributing
articles. On that note a large debt is owed to L<Pete
Houston|https://metacpan.org/author/HOUSTON> for reviewing many articles, with
a number of those being on very short notice. I'd like to thank all of this
year's authors and note that several of them contributed more than one article,
which allowed us to make it to 25.

Lastly, I'd like to thank L<Mark Fowler|https://metacpan.org/author/MARKF> for
allowing us to continue on this great tradition.

=head2 A Big Anniversary

2024 will mark year 25 of the Perl Advent Calandar. We should mark this in some
way. How will we do it? We have a year to think about it.

In the meantime, please allow me to wish all of our editors, contributors and
readers a "Happy Christmas to All and to All a Good Night".
